# Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Project: Popular Movies Stage 1 & Stage 2

Built an app, optimized for tablets, to help users discover popular and highly rated movies on the web.
It displays a scrolling grid of movie trailers, launches a details screen whenever a particular movie is selected,
allows users to save favorites, play trailers, and read user reviews. This app utilizes core Android user interface
components and fetches movie information using themoviedb.org web API.

## Why this Project
###Stage 1:

As Android projects grow in complexity, it becomes necessary to customize the
behavior of the Gradle build tool, allowing automation of repetitive tasks.
Particularly, factoring functionality into libraries and creating product
flavors allow for much bigger projects with minimal added complexity.

##What Will I Learn?
###Stage 1:

You will fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
You will use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
You will incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write

###Stage 2:

You will build a fully featured application that looks and feels natural onthe latest
Android operating system (Lollipop, as of May 2015).
You will optimize the UI experience for both phones and tablets.

##Why this Project?
###Stage 1:
To become an Android developer, you must know how to bring particular mobile experiences to life.
Specifically, you need to know how to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs),
fetch data from network services, and optimize the experience for various mobile devices.
You will hone these fundamental skills in this project.

By building this app, you will demonstrate your understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Android.
Your app will communicate with the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.
